# Indoor-Environment-Sensors
Code for Indoor Environment Sensor Kit

## Introduction

We have compiled and resourced together our best sensors and modules that you need to easily start building your very own Indoor Environment Sensor device. With this kit, we even took the liberty to simplify your coding so all you need to do is just upload the code to your board and start monitoring your environment!

 

What’s included in the kit are qwiic sensors and modules that can help you build an Indoor Environment Sensor device for your home or office or science project for school! 

 

This kit is also IOT compatible and can also be easily configured so you can monitor your environment’s data on your desktop, tablet or smartphone device.

## Project Overview
 

This project will be utilising Zio modules to build an Indoor Environment Sensor device. 

 

Zio is a new line of open sourced, compact, and grid layout boards, fully integrated for Arduino and Qwiic ecosystem. Designed ideally for wearables, robotics, small-space limitations or other on the go projects. Check out other awesome Zio products [here](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/Zio).
